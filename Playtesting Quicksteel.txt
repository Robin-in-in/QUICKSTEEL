Playtesting Quicksteel
*indicating priority/how much I like the idea in parentheses if needed

- Add indicator for enemy strikepoint (will change game flow alot for better or worse, high prio)

- Make sound cues, panning/reverb system (medium prio)

- Make screen bigger so you have more information
	option2: make an edge of screen indicator for enemy player, if you think increasing canvas is too hard. (I think this makes more sense, but might not honestly be necessary w strike indicator and sound cues, so wait for those)

- Make skin change on kill streak (should only think about this after I implement actual skins)

- Split the map into quadrants and respawn players on other side when they die (low prio, but shouldn't be too high effort)

- Add character borders on invinicibility

- Implement skins, alternates, variants w/e

- Figure out stripe/payment API implementation  that would work best

- Set up lobby system (high prio, this is the most broken thing about the game)

- Hitbox might need adjusting, the extra length feels jarring.

- Make bigger map for more freedom of movement before hitting borders.
